# Ground-humidity-measurement-with-arduino-and-esp-32
Order made by a friend who wanted a ground humidity sensor which measurements could be taken anytime, anywhere.

This project uses an DHT-11 for measure the temperature in celsius of air, as well as the humidity.
Also the measurement of the soil humidity is determined by a soil moisture sensor.
The interface of the project is provided by a telegram bot set inside a esp-32.
The communication between both, the arduino and the esp-32 is made via Serial.

Note: This is my first project with arduino, so please, send your recommendations.
